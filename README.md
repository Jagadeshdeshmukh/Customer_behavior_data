# Customer_behavior_dataset
Real world  data analysis project showcasing Customer_bahavior_data using  Sql, Python and Power Bi tools

Overview:
This project showcases an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow from raw data to actionable business insights. The objective is to analyze a dataset, extract meaningful patterns, and communicate results through SQL analysis, interactive dashboards, and professional reporting.

The project demonstrates practical skills in:

* Data analysis using Python
* Data cleaning and transformation
* SQL-based querying and insights
* Business intelligence using Power BI
* Reporting and presentation for stakeholders

Dataset
The dataset is a structured business dataset used for analytical purposes.

Details:

* Format: CSV
* Type: Structured (tabular data)
* Size: Medium-scale dataset
* Source: Public / Provided dataset

The dataset includes:

* Categorical fields (e.g., category, region, product)
* Numerical fields (e.g., sales, revenue, quantity, ratings)
* Date fields for trend analysis

Tools & Technologies

Programming & Analysis

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Jupyter Notebook

Databases & SQL

* PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* SQL for data extraction and analysis

Visualization & Reporting
* Power BI – Interactive Dashboard
* Gamma – Business Presentation (PPT)
* MS Word / PDF – Final Report


 Project Steps

 1. Data Loading

* Loaded dataset into Python using Pandas.
* Checked schema, data types, and basic structure.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Performed descriptive statistics.
* Visualized distributions and trends.
* Identified missing values and outliers.

3. Data Cleaning
* Handled missing and inconsistent values.
* Removed duplicates.
* Standardized column names and formats.
* Prepared clean dataset for analysis.

4. SQL Analysis

* Wrote SQL queries to:

  * Perform aggregations
  * Filter key segments
  * Answer business questions

5. Power BI Dashboard
* Connected Power BI to SQL database.
* Built interactive dashboard with:

  * Trend charts
  * Category-wise analysis
  * Filters and slicers

6. Reporting & Presentation
* Created a structured analytical report.
* Designed a professional PPT using Gamma for stakeholders.


Dashboard:

The Power BI dashboard provides:
* Time-based trends
* Segment and category analysis
* Interactive filtering for deep insights

The dashboard enables quick and data-driven decision-making.

Results & Insights:
Key insights derived from the analysis include:

* Identification of top-performing segments.
* Trend patterns over time.
* Key factors impacting performance.
* Areas of improvement and growth opportunities.
